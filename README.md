========

This project's purpose it to experiment with AI solutions to logic problems described in Dave Tuller & Michael Rios's book "Challenge Your Brain Math & Logic Puzzles". These problems are interesting to us because they are mostly grid based puzzles that could be modeled as constraint based problems.
